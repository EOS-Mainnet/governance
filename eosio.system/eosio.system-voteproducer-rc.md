The `voteproducer` action casts a valid vote for up to 30 Block Producer Candidates. 

As an authorized party I, {{ signer }}, wish to vote on behalf of the account {{ voter }} in favor of the Block Producer Candidates {{ producers }} with a voting weight equal to all EOS tokens currently owned by {{ voter }} and staked for CPU or Network bandwidth, and the equivalent value of REX tokens that {{ voter }} holds. 

If I am not the beneficial owner of these shares I stipulate that I have been authorized to vote these shares by their beneficial owner(s). 

I stipulate I have not, and will not, accept anything of value in exchange for these votes, on penalty of confiscation of these tokens, and other penalties. 

I acknowledge that using any system of automatic voting, re-voting, or vote refreshing, or allowing such a system to be used on my behalf or on behalf of another, is forbidden and doing so violates this contract.
