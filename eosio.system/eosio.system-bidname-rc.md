As an authorized party I, {{ bidder }}, wish to bid the amount of {{ bid }} toward purchase of the account name {{ newname }}.

I am aware that I cannot revoke my bid of {{ bid }} EOS. I will only receive it back if I am outbid by at least 10% by another user. 

My bid of {{ bid }} EOS for the account name {{ newname }} will only be awarded if it holds the highest bid for any new account name, for a period of consecutive 24 hours.
