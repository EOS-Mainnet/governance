The `buyrex` action allows an account to exchange EOS tokens from their REX fund for REX tokens.

As an authorized party I, {{ signer }}, wish to buy REX on the account {{ from }} with {{ amount }} EOS.

I am aware of, and have fulfilled, all voting requirements needed to participate in the REX marketplace.

I am aware that I will need to satify the maturing period before being able to transfer these REX tokens back into EOS tokens.
